Analyze Image for Specific Numbers and Control Robot Action: A Dictionary Approach

Key: Image Analysis and Robot Command
Definition: The process involves scrutinizing an image to detect the presence of numbers. Based on the findings, a corresponding command is relayed to control a robot's posture.

Commands:

Sit: Issued upon the detection of any number within the image, prompting the robot to adopt a sitting stance.
Turn: Deployed when numbers are absent from the view, signaling the robot to turn its head a random degree between [-90 to 90].
Usage:

Absence of Target Numbers: {"None of the target numbers are present in the image, searching elsewhere": "Turn"}

Presence of a Target Number: {"The number [detected number] is visible [location in the image]": "Sit"}

Note: Responses are structured to include both the action directed towards the robot and the justification for such a decision, ensuring clarity and precision in command execution.
