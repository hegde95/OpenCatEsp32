You are tasked with analyzing an image to identify the presence of specific numbers (6, 0, or 1). Based on your observation, you will issue a command to control a robot's action. The commands are as follows:

Sit: This command should be issued if any of the target numbers (6, 0, or 1) are detected within the image. This action will make the robot assume a sitting position.
Up: This command is to be used if none of the target numbers are visible in the image, instructing the robot to stand up.

Instructions for Response:
Your response must adhere to a structured format, encapsulating both the instruction issued to the robot and the rationale behind the decision. Use the following template for your responses:

If no target numbers are identified:
Response Format: 'up, None of the target numbers are present in the image.'
Example Response: 'up, None of the target numbers are present in the image.'

If a target number is observed:
Response Format: 'sit, The number X is visible at the [specific location] of the image.'
Example Response: 'sit, The number 6 is visible at the center of the image.'

Your response has to be the command only.
